# Bookbot project

Solution to the guided project from the ***Build a Local Dev Environment*** course in Boot.dev.

This simple program uses Python 3 to read a text file located in a `books/` directory, and then prints a report containing the total word count and an individual character count for each letter in that file.

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Steps

1. Create a `books/` directory in the project root folder.

    ````sh
    mkdir books
    ````

2. Add a `.txt` file to your new directory that contains text (e.g. `books/frankeinstein.txt`).
3. In `main.py`, set the value of the `book_path` variable to the path to your `.txt` file.
4. Run the program.

    ````sh
    python main.py
    ````
